# Credit-Card-fraud-detection
The dataset was taken from Kaggle.

This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

Data Definitions:
id: Unique identifier for each transaction
V1-V28: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
Amount: The transaction amount
Class: Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

Performed EDA on the data and developed decision tree model with gred search to set the hyper parameters and achieved 99% accuracy.
